# api-Workday-schedular

## Description
The Workday Scheduler displays time blocks with a textarea to enter scheduled information and buttons to save the scheduled items to be viewed later.  I used JavaScript and JQuery to dynamically display the html and style the items on the page.  I learned how to use local storage to save the items entered into the textareas and also how to retrieve those items from local storage so that when the page is refreshed, the text area won't loose the information that was entered.  I also used setInterval to update the class of the text area based on the current time.
## Languages
This project using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery.
